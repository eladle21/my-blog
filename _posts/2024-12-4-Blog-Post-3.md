<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n my previous post I looked into NBA player specific data regarding Plus/Minus.  With the help of my streamlit app, I've been able to explore new trends between many other statistics that help teams win games.  Through this streamlit app, you'll be able to make new discoveries into your favorite teams and players.</p>


## Introduction

This streamlit app was created to continue exploratory data analysis into specific NBA player statistics from the 2023-2024 NBA regular season.  Just like in my analysis from the last post, this app highlights any player who logged at least one minute of regular season play.  This streamlit app still allows analysis into player and team Plus/Minus statistics but I've expanded the stats shown and compared to allow for greater insight into a player's and team's production on court.

## Motivating Question

Finding a connection between a singular stat, combination of stats, or mismatch of opponent stats that best attribute to outscoring an opponent has motivated me to build this app.  This search for connection has intrigued me and being able to work in the NBA as an analyst would be my dream job. Finding a way to obtain an edge over an opponent in an NBA game would be extremely valuable to a team's front office.  Creating this app has allowed me to produce a deliverable in which teams can extract information based on their own needs, which could hopefully lead to future work for an NBA team!

## My Streamlit App

My [Streamlit App](https://nba-player-statistics-blog-3.streamlit.app/) can show you the basic stats for your basic questions.  I have broken it down into 3 tabs; summary statistics, visual analysis in the form of a bar chart, and player comparison in the form of a radar chart.  

At the bottom of each tab, there is an expandable summary statistics table that can show you the numbers behind what you are visually seeing.  

There is a filter that can be applied to this each tab which can drill down by teams as well as games played by these players.

### Tab 1 - Summary

The first tab shows you a summary of NBA player specific stats.  You are able to see the mean, standard deviation, min/max, and different quartiles of each of the most important stats for an individual player.  In the screenshot below, I've filtered only teams in the Northeast division who have played 30 games.  This could be insightful to compare individual players within this division to the averages from it.

### Tab 2 - Visual Analysis

The second tab allows you to visually compare the average stats of each players average, broken down by team.  So for points, it shows the average points per game for each individual player on that team, not the average points per game of a specific team.  This is to help show if a team has a diverse scoring game plan, if they keep a short rotation, or some other possible insights into a teams game plan.

### Tab 3 - Player Comparison

The last tab is to compare two individual players on 6 of the most important individual statistics.  This radar chart compares two players on their averages for points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, and turnovers.  This can help you to see the impact of a singular player or compare two different players to answer any comparison question you may have.

## Key Insights

One key insight I've gained from this app was from comparing two players directly to each other.  I compared two very different players in the image above found in tab 3.  Rudy Gobert is a center known for defense, Trae Young is a point guard known for offense.  They have two very different play styles and I thought it would be interesting to see their comparison in the radar chart.

You can see with their one dimensional distribution in the radar chart that their play styles are also one dimensional and they focus on their respective strengths.  I organized the radar chart so that complimentary stats were opposite to each other, like blocks to rebounds and turnovers to assists.  This allows for interesting individual player insight as well as play style comparison between two players like Rudy Gobert and Trae Young.

## Addition resources

One of my favorite sites for NBA stats is [Statmuse](https://www.statmuse.com/nba).  They do a wonderful job of providing a visually appealing website while having all the information needed for any level of NBA fan.  Stats are updated live and contain various different points of interest.  Statmuse has a wonderful feature where you can type a very specific question and see results as if you were talking to an AI.  For example, you can type "How many games have the Boston Celtics scored 150+ points" and it will show you a table containing all you'd need to know regarding these games.  You can see their opponent, the date, the results, and so many other sites.

If you're an NBA fanatic, or a fan of a great looking data visualization website, I would highly recommend Statmuse.

For those who want another tool similar to tab 3, or player comparison, there's a tool built by [Stat Head Basketball](https://stathead.com/basketball/versus-finder.cgi) that can show you not only one-on-one NBA player comparison but also how a player played against a specific team.

## Conclusion

This streamlit app is a wonderful tool to dive into EDA for NBA players and teams.  While my initial question was regarding individual performance of NBA players, as shown in their Plus/Minus statistic, this tool is able to provide insight into this stat as well as many other basic individual statistics.  It can answer questions from "how does my favorite player's play style compare to this player" or "what is this team's play style, as shown by their average players stat distribution?"  This app was built to enable insight to your wildest questions, so get after it and enable yourself with information that teams would pay big money for!
