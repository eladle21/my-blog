<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n my previous post I looked into NBA player specific data, regarding Plus/Minus.  With the help of my streamlit app, I've been able to explore new trends between many other statistics that help teams win games.  Through this streamlit app, you'll be able to make new discoveries into your favorite teams and players.</p>


## Introduction

This streamlit app was created to continue exploratory data analysis into specific NBA player statistics from the 2023-2024 NBA regular season.  Just like in my analysis from the last post, this app highlights any player who logged at least one minute of regular season play.  This streamlit app still allows analysis into player and team Plus/Minus statistics but I've expanded the stats shown and compared to allow for greater insight into a player's and team's production on court.

## Motivating Question

What has motivated me to continue analysis on NBA statistics is if there is a singular stat, combination of stats, or mismatch of opponent stats that best attribute to outscoring an opponent.  If there is a way to get an edge over an opponent in an NBA game, this would be extremely valuable to a team's front office.  This has always intrigued me and being able to work in the NBA as an analyst would be my dream job.  Creating this app has allowed me to produce a deliverable in which teams can extract information based on their own needs.  This could possibly attribute to future work in the NBA if deemed valuable.

## Key Insights

My [Streamlit App](https://nba-player-statistics-blog-3.streamlit.app/) can show you some basic stats for your basic questions.  One key insight is comparing two players directly to each other.

## Addition resources

One of my favorite sites for NBA stats is [Statmuse](https://www.statmuse.com/nba).  They do a wonderful job of providing a visually appealing website while having all the information needed for any level of NBA fan.  Stats are updated live and contain various different points of interest.  Statmuse has a wonderful feature where you can type a very specific question and see results as if you were talking to an AI.  For example, you can type "How many games have the Boston Celtics scored 150+ points" and it will show you a table containing all you'd need to know regarding these games.  You can see their opponent, the date, the results, and so many other sites.

If you're an NBA fanatic, or a fan of a great looking data visualization website, I would highly recommend Statmuse.
