<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this post, we’ll dive into the world of sports analytics, looking at how it has impacted the growth of sports, the careers it has created, and ways you can incorporate it into your own life.  As a data scientist, this is how you can provide value to this ever-growing market in value and experience.</p>


## Introduction

In the past couple years we have seen data analytics and statistics revolutionize various professional fields, of which the sporting world is no exception.  As of 2023 the Sports Technology market is valued at $18.7 billion projected to reach $105.6 billion by 2033, which is a staggering 18.9% CAGR.  This growth will provide you with job openings across the industry; marketing, viewer experience, scouting, athletic performance, and countless others built on data analytics.

We have seen the sporting world transform from a gut-feeling and “eye test” industry to one fueled by numbers.  Decisions made from the front office to the courts or fields have been transformed and magnified by the power of data analytics.  Teams can better scout, prepare for opponents, minimize injuries, and maximize revenue for their venues.  These transformations effect the players lives, their families, those who work within the industry, and the general consumer of sporting events.  This article is to teach you, a data scientist, how you can use your expertise to change the game.


### How Sports Have Evolved Due to Analytics

Sports analytics have been instrumental in shaping the strategies of teams and athletes across different sports.  One case study of this has been popularized by the book and movie Moneyball.  The Oakland Athletics’ General Manager and statistician, Billy Beane, turned undervalued players in terms of the “eye-test” to valuable assets due to their performance in certain aspects of their respective games.  These aspects were able to be seen and utilized through data analysis.

##### National Basketball Association

Other sports have followed suit.  From basketball to soccer to American football we see professional and recreational sports evolving due to insights provided by data analysis.  In basketball, we see the ability to compare players deepened by the creation of new metrics.  Historically we had few and limited metrics to analyze players in points, rebounds and assists per game.  Now we have advanced metrics such as Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Effective Field Goal Percentage (eFG%) which provide coaches, scouts, and opposing teams’ unique insight into a given player’s capabilities.

##### National Football League

The consumer experience has been heightened by data analytics, as seen in NFL games streamed by Amazon Prime.  In game stats are shown live as watchers admire peak human performance.  We get insight into how difficult different catches and throws really are as a “Catch Probability” is shown live as a quarterback releases the ball from his fingers.

##### Wearable Tech

Wearable technology has increased the ability trainers and team doctors have to care for their teams.  These technologies allow us to see strengths and weaknesses of a player’s body, metrics used to track their physical activity, and how their body reacts to different stressors.  This information greatly aids in reducing injuries, improving recovery times, and increasing athletes’ longevity in their careers.

The utilization of data analysis by teams, and all their members, increase performance in almost every measurable field.  We no longer have to rely on instinct alone but can put numbers where our mouths are and have hunches backed up and realities changed by sports analytics.


### Jobs Created by Sports Analytics:

With the increase usage of data by the sporting world, numerous careers have been created within the sports industry.  We see jobs such as data scientists and analysts to performance scientists and scouting analysts.  The demand for professionals with a grasp for statistics and machine learning has never been higher and has never been more valuable across this industry.

Key roles within sports analytics include:

- **Data Scientist/Analyst**: These individuals are responsible for gathering, cleaning, and analyzing various forms of sporting data to provide insights into team performance, player health, and game strategy.  This data can range from game statistics to recorded film.

- **Performance Analyst**: This role involves analyzing player performance, often using wearable devices that collect data on everything from heart rate to acceleration. Performance analysts play a key role in player development and injury prevention.

- **Sports Scouting Analyst**: While the “eye-test” is valuable and needed in scouting, advanced analytics allow scouting analysts to compare recruits on a deeper level.  Scouting analysts utilize data to know which leagues or locations provide the highest probability of transitioning a player from amateur to professional levels.

- **Business Insight Analyst**: In this role, the focus is optimizing business operations. This can include ticket pricing strategies, merchandising, or even scheduling to increase profitability while still providing a unique consumer experience.

### How You Can Use Sports Analytics in Your Life

You don’t need to be working for a professional sports team to get involved in sports analytics. While there is ample need for data scientists in this field, there are plenty of ways to integrate sports analytics into your daily life as a student, amateur athlete, or fan.

- **Fantasy Sports**: Fantasy leagues are a great, low-risk, way to apply sports analytics knowledge. By understanding advanced metrics and predictive models, you can simulate building a team and outperforming competitors.  Fantasy sports gives a recreational environment for you to transform sports analytics into measurable performance.

- **Personal Fitness**: A more personal application of sports analytics is in wearable fitness trackers and apps that help you monitor your own performance. Your various goals and fitness level can be enhanced by basic data analysis.  Tracking your heart rate, steps, and intensity can give you valuable insights. Understanding the data behind your performance allows you to fine-tune your unique training to see better results.
