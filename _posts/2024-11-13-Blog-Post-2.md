<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this post, we'll look into the correlation between basic, individual statistics from each NBA player in the 2023-2024 season and their on-court plus/minus.  This plus/minus metric is a positive or negative value representing the points scored by the players team minus the points scored by the opposing team, only when that player is on the court.  This analysis could give us greater insight into how an NBA player could maximize their input through any single statistic to produce the most points scored by their team.</p>


## Introduction

Basketball is a game decided by individual moments.  Moments which take place over the span of 48 minutes of gameplay, split into 4 quarters.  Players on NBA teams are given allotments of these minutes to accomplish one goal, score more points than their opponent.  Basketball can be a simple game when broken down into that single element, whichever team scores more, wins.  Coaches, scouts, general managers, owners, and players have put in countless hours and dollars into perfecting their game, team, and plan to accomplish that one goal.  Through simple data analysis, we could bring new light to this question and gain invaluable insight into how we can get the most out of an individual players' moments.


### Motivating question

Are there individual player statistics that would attribute the most to a player's on-court plus/minus, as explained by the correlation coefficient between these two figures?  

If we are able to nail down which individual statistic is most correlated with a player's on-court plus/minus, then we could inform teams and players of where in-game efforts could be focused to accomplish the goal of scoring more than the opponent.  Further data analysis could provide insight into where a team or player falls below the league average and therefore is leaving valuable points on the table.  For now, we will just dive into the above motivating question.


### NBA API

The API that I used to form my data set and attempt to answer my motivating question is found in a GitHub repo, operated by a GitHub user with the handle "swar" under the "nba_api" repo.  This repo has created a python package which allowed for ease of scraping.  A screenshot of this python package is included below.

	<figcaption>The above package import code can be used to easily scrape a desired statistic from the GitHub NBA repo.</figcaption>
</figure>

This API contains over 50 different categories of statistics pertaining to the NBA.  To show the depth of this API, a few of these categories are:
 - **NBA Draft Combine Results**
 - **Franchise Leaders in Specific Statistics**
 - **Team Game Logs**
 - **Synergy Play Types**


#### Ethics

This repo is pulled daily from the [NBA Website](www.nba.com).  The NBA's terms of use for their proprietary information is found [here](https://www.nba.com/termsofuse).

The use of NBA statistics is ethical as long as the following guidelines are kept:
<figure>
	<img src="https://eladle21.github.io/my-blog/assets/img/nba_guidelines.png" alt=""> 
	<figcaption>These are the guidelines regarding the private use of NBA statistics.</figcaption>
</figure>

Based on these guidelines, I believe it to be ethical to use the NBA's proprietary data for this purpose.


### Steps to scrape data

The initial step for accessing this data would be found in the package installation screenshot in the API section of this blog.

To find more specific data regarding your own interests and questions, the next step should be a thorough review of the data sets within this API.  It is well documented and broad so I believe almost any statistical question regarding the NBA could be answered through these data sets.

Each data set is different, so to scrape the data from the API to your local machine in python, you would have to look within the API documentation to find specific tables and feature names that you're interested in.  My code scrapes the API as follows.

	<figcaption>This is the code I used to scrape the NBA API to create my own unique dataframe to help answer my motivating question.</figcaption>
</figure>

I created my dataframe using individual player statistics that I believe to be most correlated with the outcome of an NBA game.  These statistics were created by scraping the season totals for each NBA player and dividing those totals by the number of games they played, which shows their season averages.


### Plus/Minus Summary Statistics

My final dataset contained 572 individual NBA players, or every person who logged at least one minute of gameplay in the NBA regular season of 2023-2024.  This dataset contained 21 features, 3 of which were player_id, player name, and team the player played for.  The other 18 were individual statistics calculated as explained in the "Steps needed to get data" section.

To answer my motivating question I calculated the summary statistics of the NBA's individual player plus/minus statistic.

	<figcaption>These are the summary statistics for a player's plus/minus stat.</figcaption>
</figure>

Something that I found interesting was the average and median plus/minus is below 0, with the mean at -0.43 and median at -0.40.

#### Correlation Coefficient

Furthering my analysis into the correlation of plus/minus and other individual statistics, I created a graph to show the correlation coefficient between these stats.

<figure>

	<figcaption>This is a graph showing the correlation coefficient for individual player stats.</figcaption>
</figure>

I also created 6, individual dot plots of the correlation between individual stats and plus/minus.  I plotted the 3 features with the greatest and the 3 with the lowest correlation coefficient with plus/minus.

<figure>

	<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

Something of note, the 3 highest correlated stats with plus/minus are a player's games played, their points scored, and field goals made.  These are the most intuitive statistics that would translate to more points scored than an opponent.

The 3 lowest correlated stats are less intuitive in 3-point field goals attempted, turnovers, and free throw percentage.  It makes sense to say as a player turns the ball over to their opponent, they would allow the opponent to score more than their team.  Free throw percentage was interesting since the better someone shot from the free throw line didn't necessarily translate to more points scored than opponent.


### Conclusion

The name of the game is outscore your opponent.  To break it down simply into a single player statistic is difficult to do, but I attempted to find the individual statistic which is the most correlated with a team outscoring their opponent, when a certain player is on the court.

The three individual player statistics which are most correlated with a player's plus/minus are:
 - **Games Played: 0.245**
 - **Points scored: 0.243**
 - **Field Goals Made: 0.237**

The three individual player statistics which are least correlated with a player's plus/minus are:
 - **3-point Field Goals Attempted: 0.145**
 - **Turnovers: 0.10**
 - **Free-throw Percentage: 0.10**

Utilizing this information and focusing on avoiding those stats which correlate to the lowest plus/minus or those stats which correlate with the highest plus/minus could provide a strategic advantage.  This could allow millions of dollars, countless hours, and several losses to be saved and turned into success.
